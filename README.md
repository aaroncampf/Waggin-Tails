# Waggin-Tails


Steps to  Clone

- Clone entire WaggingTails Repo to your Intellij

- Go to intellij open folder BACKEND in intellij 
  - Dependencies added:  thymeleaf, spring boot and spring boot dev
  - havent added sql and jpa dependcies yet.
-  Go to VS CODE
  - Open folder FRONTEND in vscode.
  - install react/vite

Tip: You can choose to open entire project in intellij/vscode but having them in seperate apps for development will make it easier to seperate the frontend and backend without distractions. 

TIP 2: Once we are in respective frontend or backend folders, we can create our respective feature branches to start working locally.  

Run these commands in the terminal to experience full functionality:

npm i swiper

npm install react-hook-form

npm install

npm run dev (to open in browser. Use "h + enter" to see shortcuts)
